Hi,
we have decided to add an incredible feature for our game,
we think that for each game in this world, u have to sign up in it to play that game,
so we have created a simple login structure;

how did we implement it?:
we built a json file that stores all usernames of players with their passwords with all previous game scores for that
specific player, at the beginning we start with an empty json,
then, when a player enters his credentials (username+password), we check if he played before and his credentials
are correct (matches what's in the json file), if that's the case, we start appending to his
existing credentials (updating game scores list), otherwise we add his credentials to our json with an empty list of game scores.
it's worth mentioning that when an existing player enters the game again, the game displays the scores
of the previous game retries in a chart at the right side of the screen.
